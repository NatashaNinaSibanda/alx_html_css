HTML Advanced Project â€” CSS Styling & Design
Overview
For this project, I focused on improving a semantic HTML page by adding advanced CSS styles based on a detailed design provided in Figma. 
The goal was to bring the page to life visually by carefully applying colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts to match the original design as closely as possible. 
I worked on making sure everything looked consistent and polished, while also keeping the HTML clean and semantic. 
This was a great chance for me to practice working with CSS properties like Flexbox and Grid, use custom fonts, and include images like logos, which all help create a professional and user-friendly web page. 
Along the way, I learned a lot about balancing exact design specs with writing neat, maintainable code.

Project Goals
Implement pixel-perfect CSS styles based on the Figma design.

Ensure typography and color schemes match the original vision.

Use modern CSS layout tools like Flexbox or Grid.

Adjust and optimize images and logos for clarity and performance.

Keep the HTML semantic and clean, making modifications only where necessary (e.g., adding img tags).

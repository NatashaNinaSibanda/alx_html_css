# HTML Advanced Project — CSS Styling & Design

## Overview

This project is about transforming a semantic HTML page into a visually stunning website by applying advanced CSS styling, following a detailed design provided in Figma. The goal is to practice CSS skills such as typography, layout using Flexbox/Grid, colors, spacing, and image integration, while keeping the HTML clean and semantic.

Working on this project helped me better understand how to translate a design mockup into code, carefully managing styles to achieve pixel-perfect results. It was also a chance to get comfortable with modern CSS layout techniques and responsive considerations.

## What I Worked On

- Used Flexbox and CSS Grid for efficient, responsive layouts.  
- Included logos and images where necessary, updating the HTML accordingly.  
- Maintained semantic HTML with meaningful tags.  
- Rounded decimal CSS values for cleaner code while maintaining accuracy.
